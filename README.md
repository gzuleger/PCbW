PCbW is a TI-BASIC utility for the TI-84 Plus CE that quickly estimates the quantity of small identical parts using total weight and weight per piece.
It’s designed for makers, hobbyists, electronics sorting, and inventory counting when precision scales are available.

How It Works
1. You weigh all the pieces together
2. Enter the total weight
3. Enter the weight of a single piece
4. PCbW calculates the estimated piece count instantly
